# Coco reddit

Coco reddit is a moderation bot for reddit that enables subreddits to use Coco's moderation mechanism. You can check more about Coco [here](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/coco-contracts).

In contrast to Coco's deployment on Rinkeby Arbitrum, this bot (and its contracts) are deployed on Reddit's Arbitrum Chain (more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/owspo6/instructions_to_add_reddits_arbitrum_testnet_to/))

You can find the accompanying front-end [here](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/coco-frontend-general).
